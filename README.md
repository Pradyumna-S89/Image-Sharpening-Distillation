from Bharati Vidyapeeth's college of engineering under Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi and have developed this project under problem statement #2 for the Intel Unnati Training program
we have developed a basic teacher student model using knowledge distillation for image sharpening and all the files involved for the same have been uploaded in this repository

Dataset contains all the images used for training, results has 3 samples showcasing difference between ground truth image(HR),input image(LR) and student produced image,
results_mos has 40 random samples having the actual image(HR),input image(LR),teacher and student generated images for showcasing the difference in their nature to the viewer

A folder named "report" has a pdf file summarizing our course of actions and a video hereby briefly explaining how the entire system was set up as well as the outputs covered
